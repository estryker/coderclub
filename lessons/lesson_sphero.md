# Sphero with Blockly / Ruby

## Review



## Turtle Graphics

### Blockly
This is a bit of a review, but should help the students write their Sphero application.

Note the examples tab for ideas of things you can do. 

## Sphero
Currently, we must use Google Chrome to run the Sphero Blockly app.

* Have Sphero draw a square, triangle, or other polygon
* Have Sphero turn around when it hits something
* Have Sphero flash randomly and turn when it hits something
