# Event Driven Programming

## Intro / Review (No computer, 15 minutes)
* Concepts learned so far:
 * Commands
 * Loops
 * if/else
 * functions

## Hands on lesson

Three pairs of index cards:
Pair 1:  
  Card1A - Say "Banana"
  Card1B - When you hear "Banana",  get up and walk around your desk

Pair 2: 
  Card2A - Say "Apple"
  Card2B - When you hear "Apple", do a drum roll on your desk

Pair 3:
  Card3A - Say "Orange"
  Card3B - When you hear "Orange", get up and hop on one foot

This type of flow control is called 'Event Driven programming'

### Ruby
```ruby
 def onBanana
    walk_around_desk
 end
```

```ruby
  def onClick
     some_command
  end
```

## Conclusion
New concepts? How are event driven commands different from what we had learned before?
