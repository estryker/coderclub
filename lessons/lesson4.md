# Event Driven Programming

## Intro / Review (No computer, 15 minutes)
* Concepts learned so far:
 * Commands
 * Loops
 * if/else
 * functions

## Hands on lesson

Three pairs of index cards:
Pair 1:  
  Card1A - Say "Banana"
  Card1B - When you hear "Banana",  get up and walk around your desk

Pair 2:
