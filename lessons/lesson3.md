# Drawing continued, Functions
This lesson could be considered extra.  We are using it after one week off
to do some review and to give the students time to really work on the
harder turtle lessons.  Also, since functions were just  introduced, 

## Review
Have the students describe:

Loops and Functions 

## Hands on lesson

Human calculators

### Function 1
Double the number given

Input 1A: 7

Input 1B:  -12

Input 1C:  "Apple"

Ruby
```ruby

def function1(number)
  return number * 2
end

```

C
```C

 int function1(int number) {
   return(number * 2);
 }

```
### Function 2
Add the two numbers

Input 2A:   5, 6 

Input 2B:   0, -17

Input 2C:   "Chocolate", "Vanilla"

Ruby
```ruby

def function2(number1, number2)
  return number1 + number2
end

```

C
```C

 int function2(int number1, int number2) {
   return(number1 + number2);
 }

```

The job of a function is to do one specific task so that it can be reused later.
