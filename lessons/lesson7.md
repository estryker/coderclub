# Ruby - Strings

## Guided lesson - Mini Tasks
First, go to these three links as tabs in your browser:

[Ruby in the Browser] (http://coderclub-rails.herokuapp.com/try/ruby)
 
[Ruby-doc - String] (http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html) 

[Ruby-doc - Array] (http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html)

Note that as you learn any language, you will remember some of the common functionality that you need, 
but you will always have to look things up in documentation like this.

## Self guided lesson
Write your own interactive program that a partner can run. Have it ask questions

## JRuby Usage
### Set up:
* Download jruby jar file:
[jruby] (https://s3.amazonaws.com/jruby.org/downloads/1.7.17/jruby-complete-1.7.17.jar)

* Download .bat file
[jruby .bat file] (https://github.com/estryker/coderclub/blob/master/windows_files/jruby.bat)

* Make a directory in C:/ called CoderClub and put the two files in there

### 
```
jruby.bat jirb_swing
```

Try the examples that we used in the Guided lesson. 

Also, check out <Tab> completion - it is very helpful!
