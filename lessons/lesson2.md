The goal here is to learn flow control and looping.  

## Intro / review (15 Mins, no computer)
* What kind of loop structure do you use when you know how many times you will repeat?
 * What if you don't know how many times? 
 * Have we needed to know what iteration we are in? (i.e. what the 'loop counter' is?)  

## Guided Lesson (30 minutes)
Code.org artist
Have the students complete the lesson here:
[Artist lesson](http://studio.code.org/s/artist/stage/1/puzzle/1)

* Allow the students to go through the first half on their own. If they are done quickly, they can help a neighbor
* Stop after they reach page 5 to discuss the working code
 * Does anyone see any redundancy in the steps?  
 * Notice in step 6, we add another loop
* On step 10 - wouldn't it be nice to have a function that accepted a parameter for the number of sides you wanted? 
 * How would the number of degrees in the turn be changed?

## Self guided lesson (25 minutes)
* Have the students save their work to their GAFE account
