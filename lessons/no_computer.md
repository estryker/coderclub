These can be used when there are technical difficulties, or when they are appropriate for the lesson. 

## Activity 1 - Write commands to draw shapes
Have the students pair up, and on index cards - one student will write the explicit instructions on how to put a pencil to paper to draw shapes. Then they can switch to draw a different shape

## Activity 2 - Walk to the door
Pick a student that will be blindfolded.  Have the class write the instructions to have them navigate through the desks from where they start to the door.  Once the instructions are written, the class must dictate the instructions to the student to have them move. 

## Activity 3 - Function calls
Have the students pair up. Have them both write the instructions for a function of their own creation that requires at least one input, and whos behavior depends on the input.  Have them take turns giving each other input and executing the function. 

## Activity 4 - Function mad-lib
Have the students pair up. Have them both write the instructions for a function of their own creation that requires multiple inputs that are numbers, strings (words) and lists.  Have them execute the function after making up input.
