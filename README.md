Some lesson plans for teaching Middle schooler's how to program. 

## Overview
We will be using Blockly to introduce the students to basic programming concepts:

* Flow control
 * loops
* Logical operators
 * if/else
* Data Structures
 * Numbers
 * Strings
 * Arrays
* Functions
* User input

Then, we will be transitioning to Ruby as a way to learn text based programming. On top of working on the syntax for the basic programming concepts, the students will learn about:

* Classes
* Input/output
* Error handling
* Other Data Structures
 * Hashes (Dictionaries)
* Sorting
